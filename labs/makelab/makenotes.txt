# comments in make
#
# note the syntax of a rule:
# line 1 has a semicolon,
#   the part before is the `target'
#   the part after is the prerequisite
# line 2 starts with a TAB character.
#
# formal definition:
# if 1. the target doesn't exist, or
#    2. the prerequisite is newer,
# then (re)execute the command

# macro assignment is more tolerant to spaces than the shell
# macros are invoked with a dollar AND with braces
